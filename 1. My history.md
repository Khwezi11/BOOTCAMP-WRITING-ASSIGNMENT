I am Olwethu Khwezi Zama who was born in Prince Mshiyeni Hospital and raised by both parents who are unfortunately at the time of my birth were both not working, in the township of Umlazi which is part of the Ethekwini metropolitan in the province of Kwazulu-Natal. I attended my primary school years at Embonini Juniuor primary school in Umlazi then moved on to Hubhushe Senior primary school in the year of 2007 to start grade 5, after 3 years at Hubhushe moved to Umlazi comprehensive Technical High School for my high school studies until 2018. I then resumed at Zwelibanzi High School that is also located in my home town of Umlazi, until 2020 when I matriculated with a bachelors pass and 2 distinctions.

In terms of Tertiary or further education there is honestly nothing to say as I have not attended any, I have taken 2021 as a gap year and the year to experiment, tryout new things but ultimately find my passion and what I would like to do for the rest of my life as a career hence why I applied for the Umuzi learnership. Since been experimenting with Python from the start of the year I have decided that a life in Web Development is perfect for me and I saw Umuzi as the perfect platform to kickstart my career in Web Dev because as you learn at Umuzi you are also trained on how the technolgy working environment operates therefore you exit the learnership with industry leading expeties, knowledge and work experience which is something taht is highly corveted by employers nowadays.
