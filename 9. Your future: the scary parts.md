If I don't become successful in this bootcamp this will not mean the end of the road for me however, it will gear me up for next year's opportunity to apply again. I believe we all learn from our mistakes so next time I will clean up all mistakes that might have caused me to be to be unsuccessful in this bootcamp. I am not a individual who give sup easily, I am very determined in everything that I do. Coding is my passion, and I will nwver give up on it.
