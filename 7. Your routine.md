Well I certainly do not enjoy waking up early in the morning as my body and mind need a good few hours to adjust to the fact I'm awake, therefore this makes me a night owl as I work best as night and midnight when everyone is asleep and that's when the network is at it's best.

Therefore I would probably wake up at 09:00AM to 10:00AM and start working at 12:00PM all the way till 02:00AM at midnight taking 2 one and a half hour breaks thoughout the day.
