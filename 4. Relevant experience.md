I have been interested in games and gadgets growiing up but I never had much exposure to them or the science behind how computer sand the like work. But the interest has always been there du e to my inquisitive nature . So when I became fortunate enough to get a chance ot delve into learning the why and how, I set out to teach myself how to code. Through watching YouTube tutorials, I taught myself how to code in the Python programming language. I am fairly new at it but it has been an exciting journey and I have some amazing application ideas.
