One thing that might hinder my success is self doubt, when I start doing or learning something new and ge to some difficult sections I tend to want to quit but thanks to my amazing family who always manages to persuade me not to and push regardless if I think that the outcome won't be in my favour. But Its not as bad as It used to be I can confidently say that I have improved and continue to do so.
