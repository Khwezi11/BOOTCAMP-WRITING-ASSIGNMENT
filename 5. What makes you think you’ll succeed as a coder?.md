I am an individual who has a strong desire to learn different ways of doing things and how technology works. I am a hardworking individual who is passionate about making a change in everything that I do. I have learnt how to code in Python on my own and I will use that eagerness to learn and be a successful coder. I am a problem solver, even during my high school years I was that kind of a student who was relied upon when it comes to technical questions. I commit myself to every task that has been given to me until I see positive results. I am an inquisitive person who is always curious on how technology works and to be given this opportunity will expose me to learning lots of things from designing to programming of websites.  As we are living in a country where the tech industry is booming, learning how to code will be the most useful tool in terms of solving problems.
