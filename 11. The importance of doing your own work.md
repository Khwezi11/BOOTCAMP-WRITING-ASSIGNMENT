- Coding is both science and an art. Few disciplines can boast this distinction. At the very core of coding is problem solving. The science aspect of coding requires the understanding of fundamentals which are largely common in virtually all programming languages. A stunted understanding of these fundamentals will stunt how effective you will be in exploiting any programming language to its fullest extent. By extrapolation, this implies a limitation in problem solving.
The art of programming lends itself to the flair to which one exercises the skill of drafting a design before coding. The art of intuitive indentation and the habit of commenting on one's code.
Both aspects require repeated practice. It simply cannot be mastered overnight and most certainly cannot be perfected by plagiarizing another’s work. While finding inspiration from another’s work is noble, copying another’s work becomes silly when it lends you with a good semester mark but a horrible exam mark. It goes against the crux of problem solving. If copying ever becomes a real possibility, then there is a problem that needs solving. Solve it.

It is vital to take time to understand the concepts. This can lead on to appreciate the problem-solving approach of pioneers in the field of computer science. Delving into each concept allows one to stand on the shoulders of giants in the field. This will result in one finding their own rhythm and proclivity in problem solving. In some instances, ingenuity and innovation lies in improving on the very same concepts that a student is task to assimilate.
Also understanding these concepts allows coders to communicate ideas that would otherwise be cumbersome in rather concise and succinct manner building on mutually understood concepts. Collaboration is indispensable in the advancement of technology.
